### Setup and Development

1. Clone the repo.  

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/passionately-curious/asymptote.git
    ```  

2. Install hugo using your package manager.
(Mine is pacman)  

3. Refer the hugo documentation to create new posts.  
Switching to a new branch is recommended,
since cloudflare pages has preview option.

4. Run `hugo server -D` to preview the site before commiting.  

5. Commit the changes.  

6. Push the changes.
